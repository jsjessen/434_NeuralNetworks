Assignment 4: due 10-1-19
Classification by Perceptron Regression
=======================================

Use dataset randomized shortened 'glass data short.csv' to 
develop a classifier for beer-bottle glass by perceptron regression.  

Keep the class labels as 1, 2, and 6

After fitting class labels as though they are a continuous response, 
bin the results to make predictions of class assignment.  

| Fit<1.5  bin=1 | Fit>4  bin=6 | Default bin=2 |

Report the following:
	coefficient of determination (AKA R^2)
	number of records in each class and accuracy of class assignment
	overall accuracy
	3-way confusion matrix as shown below

# in class 1 assigned class 1	# in class 2 assigned class 1 	 # in class 6 assigned class 1 
# in class 1 assigned class 2 	# in class 2 assigned class 2 	 # in class 6 assigned class 2 
# in class 1 assigned class 6	# in class 2 assigned class 6 	 # in class 6 assigned class 6


Classification by regression
----------------------------
Setup perceptron regression as though brewery number (column 11) is a continuous response.
Solve normal equations for optimum weight vector.
Bin yfit to predict class assignment for examples in dataset.
Use predicted class and true class to calculate a confusion matrix.
(See slides 11-13 for MATLAB code)
