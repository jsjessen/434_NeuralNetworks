Assignment 1, due 9/5/19
Write a code for regression of nutritional rating vs sugar and fiber. 
Train with example from Cereals dataset on class web page
Report bias and slopes for predictors sugar and fiber,
coefficient of determination, R2, and standard error of estimation, s.

Consider protein, fat, and sodium separately as a third attribute, 
in addition to sugar and fiber, to predict the nutritional rating cereals.
Report the change in R2 and s relative to sugar and fiber only.

Use value of 0 for empty data cells.
data.at[57,'Sugars'] = nan

Expected output (should be close but not identical)
---------------
Sugars & Fiber:
    R^2 = 80.8%
    s = 6.24
Sugars only:
    R^2 = 58%
    s = 9.16
