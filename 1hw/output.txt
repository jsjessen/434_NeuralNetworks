Protein isn't a useful third attribute because it 
    doesn't significantly increase R² and 
    increases the standard error of estimation.

Both fat and sodium are useful third attributes because they 
    significantly increease R² and 
    decrease the standard error of estimation.

Of the attributes tested, the best combination is by far: Sugars, Fiber, Sodium
