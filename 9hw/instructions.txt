Assignment 9: due 11-5-19

Part 1
------
Apply Weka’s Genetic Search in version 3.8 to find the best subset of attributes after 100 generations in the breast-cancer data on the class webpage when Naïve Bayes is used classify benign and malignant cases. 

Report fitness for chromosomes in the 100th generation and 
Weka’s list of the best tumor characteristics for classification. 

Report the accuracy of classification and confusion matrix 
when these tumor characteristics are used to classify the breast-cancer data.


Part 2
------
Apply Weka’s InfoGain in version 3.8 to the rank leukemia gene expression dataset from HW1 by information gained. 

Report the top 5 genes. 

Use these 5 genes with Naïve Bayes to classify ALL and AML among cases in the dataset. 

Compare the accuracy using the top 5 genes to the accuracy using all the genes. 

Report the confusion matrix (ALL positive class) using the top 5 genes and 
compare to confusion matrix when all genes are used for Naïve Bayes classification.
