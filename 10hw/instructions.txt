Assignment 10: due 11-12-19

Calculate principal components of attributes in glass data short.csv
(Do not include the 10th column, which is class labels)

Report the eigenvalues ranked by decreasing magnitude. 

Calculate PoV for all eigenvalues and plot.


z=csvread(‘datafile.csv’);
sig=cov(z);
[V,D]=eig(sig)
%columns of V are the eigenvectors
%D is diagonal
%eigenvalues on diagonal are in increasing order
%invert order and store in array eigenvals
d = length(eigenvals)
for k=1:d
pov(k) = (Eig_1 + Eig_2 + ... + Eig_k) / (Eig_1 + Eig_2 + ... + Eig_k + ... + Eig_d)
plot(pov)
%index of pov array will be used as x coordinate
