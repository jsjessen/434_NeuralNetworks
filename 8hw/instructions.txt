    Start
    Result List : Right-click : Save result buffer as CSV

Adapt code from HW4 to calculate:
    - accuracy of predictions in each class 
    - overall accuracy
    - confusion matrix with column sums equal to class size

Choose a bin boundary equal to the average of the labels:
    (1 + 5) / 2 = 3
